We have downsampled this dataset in order to reduce trainging time for you when you design and fit your model to the data. It is anticipated that this process will take approximately 1 hour to run on a standard machine, although times will vary depending on your particular computer and set up. At the end of this lab, you are welcome to try training on the complete dataset and observe the impact on the model's overall accuracy. \n",
